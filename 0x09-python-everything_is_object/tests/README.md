# Python - Everything is an Object

In this engaging project, I, **Ahmed Mahmoud** (GitHub: [gwaez](https://github.com/gwaez)), explored the intricacies of object instantiation in Python. I delved into topics such as variable aliasing, object identifiers, types, and mutability. The project comprised a series of quiz-like questions, and I provided concise answers in single-line `.txt` files.
